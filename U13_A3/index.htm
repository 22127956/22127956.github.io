<h2>The history of mobile phones</h2>

<img src="images/mobile.png" alt="Mobiles history"style="float: right; padding-left:30px;"></a>
<p>The history of mobile phones began with the first call made from a handheld device in 1973 by Martin Cooper of Motorola. The first commercial mobile phone, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X, went on sale in 1983. </p>
<p>Key developments followed, including the first SMS message in 1992, the launch of the first phone with internet browsing capabilities (Nokia 7110) in 1999, the introduction of 3G networks in the early 2000s, and the 2007 release of the iPhone, which ushered in the smartphone era. </p>
