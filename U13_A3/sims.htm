<h2>SIMs</h2>

<p>A SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) is a small, removable card with an integrated circuit (chip) that securely stores information to identify and authenticate a user on a mobile network. It serves as a vital link between a mobile device (like a smartphone, tablet, or laptop) and a network provider, allowing the user to make calls, send text messages, and use mobile data services (such as 4G and 5G).</p>

<p>SIM cards have evolved in size over the years to fit the design of smaller, thinner mobile devices. The physical card sizes currently in use are: 
Standard SIM (Mini-SIM): The largest of the modern sizes, primarily found in older phones.
Micro-SIM: A smaller version used in early-to-mid 2010s smartphones.
Nano-SIM: The smallest physical SIM card, used in most modern smartphones.
eSIM (Embedded SIM): A non-physical, reprogrammable chip built directly into a device's hardware, allowing users to activate or change network plans digitally without needing a physical card. </p>
